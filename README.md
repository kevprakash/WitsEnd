# WitsEnd

## Project Setup Instructions
1. Create a new 2D project with Unity Version 2020.1.10f1 (other versions might work but this is the one it was originally made on)
   a. Make sure to take note of the project folder 
3. Close Unity once the editor opens up and everything is done loading
4. Go to the project folder and go into the Assets folder
5. Open gitbash (or whatever you use for commandline git) use the command "git clone https://github.com/kevprakash/WitsEnd.git ." without the quotes
6. Once it finishes downloading everything, open up the project in Unity again (it will probably take a while to start the first time)
7. Everything should be ready from there on out
